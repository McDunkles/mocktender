3. ***What did you accomplish this week?***
   - Lots of testing the machine and getting the final pieces together for the final demo
   - IOController feedback loop queries the most recent liquid level from the database
   to accurately dispense the correct amount of liquid
   - Email notifications are sent to the user if the liquid level goes below a threshold value. This was very fast to set up as I had already used the SMTP library earlier in the semester to email the RPi's IP to myself.
