___
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week?** 15

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours:**
   1. Writing technical memo draft: writing 2 hours
   2. Peristaltic Pump redesign + troubleshooting: CAD 8 hours
   3. Designing a gearbox for the pump: CAD 3 hours
   4. Unit test demo preparation (source code): programming 2 hours

3. ***What did you accomplish this week?***
   - Picked a topic for the technical memo (CAD and 3D printing) and started writing a script for the video
   - Had to completely redesign the pump model I was using due to it not playing well with the size of the bearings we bought.
   - Printed a gearbox due to the RPM of our motors being too high to do anything useful.
   - Prepared unit tests for the unit test demo so that they're ready to go when the pumps are complete.
  
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?***
   - We're steadily catching up to our milestone deadlines. The mechanical issues with the pump are a bit discouraging.
   I believe this is what's referred to as "integration hell".

5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? 
   1. Completing the technical memo using feedback from the peer review.
   2. Fix up all of the issues with the pumps.
   3. Wrap up working on the unit test demo, hopefully by Thursday.
   

6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** 
   - Nothing is blocking me right now.
