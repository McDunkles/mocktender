# Weekly Individual Project Update Report
### Group number: L3-G8
### Student name: Duncan MacLeod (101160585)
### Week 10 (March 22nd - 28th)
### How many hours did you spend on the project this week? 65

## **Breakdown of hours spent:**
1. Creating Database Schema: 0.5 Hours
2. Developing MVC Persistence Layer/API (mkt-persistence): 10 Hours
3. Developing Frontent UI and Repositories: 45 Hours
4. Configuring Keycloak to work in the frontend: 8 Hours
5. Met with team to plan making our video and finishing the project: 1 Hour

## **What did you accomplish this week?**
Developed the main code stack that the System Controller Pi will use, which includes the frontend, backend api, and database schema.
Configured Keycloak realms and figured out how to use the js/keycloak library to integrate it into the frontend.
Implemented API we had in mind in the persistence layer.
Developed repositories in the frontend to use the API in the persistence layer.

## **How do you feel about your progress?**
This week was very big in terms of progress. The entire frontend, persistence/api, and database layers were created and integrated together.
Configuring the Keycloak realms was a larger time sink than expected, but that is now configured and working properly with the frontend.
The API we had in mind was implemented in the persistence layer and the frontend successfully makes calls to it.

## **What are you planning to do next week?**
Update the end-to-end communication mechanism to fit our implemented API, allowing the IOController Pi to feed real data into the database instead of the test data that is currently in it.
Continue work on some of the features in the frontend, namely adding/editing/removing mocktail recipes.

Overall, get the project into a state where it is functional.

## **Is anything blocking you that you need from others?**
Nothing is blocking me.
