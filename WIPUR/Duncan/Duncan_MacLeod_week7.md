Configuring Keycloak realms: 1 hour
Researching how to use the Google Cloud Platform: 1 hour

## **What did you accomplish this week?**
Made progress on the detailed design document by working through logistics of how each Pi will communicate
Set up a simple dummy realm in Keycloak for development purposes
Reviewed how to configure VMs and subnets on the Google Cloud Platform

## **How do you feel about your progress?**
Generally speaking, I feel like we are further behind than we would like to be. This next week will need to be a pivotal week

## **What are you planning to do next week?**
Have all the hardware we currently know we need to start building our project.

Have a skeleton of the cloud infrastructure in place. Although it may seem counter-intuitive to work on the cloud before the local UI,
there are still gaps in our design plan for the cloud aspect, so having a concrete design is a priority.

## **Is anything blocking you that you need from others?**
Nothing is blocking me.
